# Community Code of Conduct

## Our Goal
We want this community to be a safe, welcoming, and inclusive place for everyone, regardless of background, identity, or experience level.

## Standards
We expect everyone to contribute to a positive environment by following these simple guidelines:

*   **Be kind and empathetic:** Treat others with respect.
*   **Be open-minded:** Respect differing viewpoints and accept constructive feedback gracefully.
*   **Be responsible:** Own your mistakes, apologize, and learn from them.
*   **Focus on the community:** Act in the best interest of the group, not just yourself.

We do not tolerate:
*   Harassment, trolling, or personal attacks.
*   Sexualized language, imagery, or unwanted advances.
*   Doxing (publishing others' private information without consent).
*   Any other behavior that makes the community feel unsafe or unprofessional.

## Enforcement
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the community leaders. We will review all reports promptly and fairly, and we will always respect the privacy of the person reporting the incident.

## Consequences
Community leaders will take action that is appropriate for the situation, which may include:
1.  **Correction:** A private warning and a request for a public apology.
2.  **Warning:** A formal warning with temporary restrictions on interaction.
3.  **Temporary Ban:** A fixed-term suspension from the community.
4.  **Permanent Ban:** A final removal from the community for severe or repeated violations.
