## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. **Check for updates:** Ensure you are using the latest version.
2. **Search first:** Check the [bug tracker](https://github.com/AbdulRehman-z/start-on-steroids/issues) to see if the issue is already known.
3. **Open an issue:** Describe what happened vs. what you expected, and include clear steps to reproduce the bug. Mention your OS and environment info.

2. Open a new issue with a clear title.
3. Explain the "what" and the "why"—how would this benefit most users?

### Your First Code Contribution
